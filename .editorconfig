# Comma-separated list of rules to disable
# Note that rules in any ruleset other than the standard ruleset will need to be prefixed
# by the ruleset identifier.
# ref: https://pinterest.github.io/ktlint/0.49.1/rules/configuration-ktlint/

# Cause: Imports must be ordered in lexicographic order without any empty lines in-between with "java", "javax", "kotlin" and aliases in the end (import-ordering)
# I'm Not Adjust Rule. Because, disabled it.
